  problem: "I need to open a problem report for part number ABC123. The brake rotor is overheating causing glazing on the pads. We track temperature above 24 degrees Celsius and we are seeing this after three to four laps during runs when the driver is braking late and aggressively into corners. The issue severity is to be prioritized as a 2. This is impacting the front brake assembly EFG234."

System:
You are an AI assistant. You will be given the definition of an evaluation metric for assessing the quality of an problem summary in a summarization task. Your job is to compute an accurate evaluation score using the provided evaluation metric.

User:
Coherence(1-5) - the collective quality of all sentences.
We align this dimension with the DUC quality question of structure and coherence
whereby "the summary should be well-structured and well-organized.
The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to a
coherent body of information about a topic."

Annotators were instructed to penalize summaries which contained redundancies and excess information.scale:
1. Read the article carefully and identify the main topic and key points.
2. Read the summary and compare it to the article. Check if the summary covers the main topic and key points of the article,
and if it presents them in a clear and logical order.
3. Assign a score for coherence on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the lowest and 5 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.

This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
